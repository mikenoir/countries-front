# countries-front
Hello, I'm Mike and the goal of this project is get information about countries via a RESTful API from restcountries.eu/ 
For this project I used HTML, CSS with bootstrap and Javascript with jQuery. 
Search your country and enjoy using this website, you dont't need special configuration to run this project :)

Feedback: It was a pleasure develop this project, nice challenge.
